# Personal Portfolio Skeleton

This project is a basic Flask-based portfolio site styled with a theme inspired by Spotify. It includes a top navigation bar for **About**, **Projects**, **Resume**, and **Contact Me**. The side navigation bar mimics Spotify's layout with **Home**, **Library**, **My Playlists**, and **Resume** links.

## Setup

1. Create a Python virtual environment and install Flask:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install Flask
```

2. Run the development server:

```bash
python app.py
```

Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser to view the site.
